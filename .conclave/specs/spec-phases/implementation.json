Remove the implementation.md check entirely.\n\n**UC-2 — Breakdown badge (client/style.css):**\nAdd a .spec-entry__phase--breakdown rule after .spec-entry__phase--analysis. Use a blue/purple tone: color: var(--accent-blue, #7ba4d4); background: rgba(123, 164, 212, 0.1). No component changes needed — workspace.tsx already renders spec-entry__phase--${spec.phase} dynamically.\n\n**UC-7 — Epic group summary (client/components/workspace.tsx):**\nIn EpicGroupRow, replace the hardcoded \"implementation\" filter with dynamic logic:\n- Define phase order: research < analysis < breakdown < implementation.\n- Find the highest phase present among any child spec.\n- Count how many children have reached that highest phase.\n- Render: \"${count} of ${total} in ${highestPhase}\".\n- If all children have phase: null, render no summary.\n\n**Final step:** Run the T-1 scanner tests — all must pass green.
